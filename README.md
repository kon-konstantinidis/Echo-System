## ECHO SYSTEM

# Summary
This is the Echo Web App.

With the aid of Plotly Dash, an interactive (potentially web-based) system is built using Python.
The system enables the user to upload DICOM files corresponding to heart sonograms, view the video scans and apply the estimation method of choice in order to calculate the heart's functional capabilities.

# Innovation
The system successfully integrates neural networks for the estimations as well as a custom-built Dash component using ReactJS serving as a specialized video player for the sonograms, offering a wide range of useful controls.
